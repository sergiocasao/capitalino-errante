<li>ARVE is now SEO friendly. Letting you specify title, description, upload date to provide search engines with the schema.org data they like to have for better indexing.</li>
<li>&lt;abbr title=&quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot;&gt;WYSIWYG&lt;/abbr&gt; Editor. No more messing around with shortcodes and previewing.</li>
<li>New improved dialog for embedding videos.</li>
<li>Embeds via pasting the URL in its own line just like WordPress!</li>
<li>Magically makes those url embedded videos responsive.</li>
<li>No &#39;lock in&#39; for the above&#39; if you use providers WordPress already supports.</li>

<li>Optionally use very powerful Shortcodes instead.</li>
<li>One single button for all providers. (for most providers not required because of URL embeds, but allows to create custom shortcodes with advanced features within seconds)</li>
<li>Responsive embeds with CSS, much better then with Javascript.</li>

<li>Clean shortcode syntax <code>[arve url=&quot;https://youtu.be/yUCFRL43Zm4&quot; /]</code>, no unnecessary shortcode wrapping.</li>
